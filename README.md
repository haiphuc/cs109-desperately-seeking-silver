This served as homework for the [CS109 Data Science cource](http://cs109.org) and is represented as a [Jupyter Notebook](HW2.ipynb).

First: We will start by examining a successful forecast that [PredictWise](http://www.predictwise.com/results/2012/president) made on October 2, 2012. This will give us a point of comparison for our own forecast models.

Second: We will build a logistic regression model to generate forecasts for this election using a new feature called Partisan Voting Index and the [Gallup poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/156437/heavily-democratic-states-concentrated-east.aspx#2).

Third: We will bring together homogeneous information about the election, by aggregating different polling results together.
